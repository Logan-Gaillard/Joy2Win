## **NOTICE !**
**Why is this project temporary ?**  
Currently, Joy-Con 2 controllers only work on Windows. Other operating systems are not supported due to how the controllers communicate. (Due to Joy-Con 2 communication protocol ?)  
  
On this project's [Discord's server](https://discord.gg/gegfNZ5Ucz) somes people work hard to figure out how Switch 2 controllers communicate.  

> [!WARNING]
> **!! This Discord's server is not part of this project, so no help will be provided there !!**  
> For questions or issues, please contact ``octokling`` on Discord or by Issues.

> [!NOTE]  
> I am not a Bluetooth communication expert. I have been helped multiple times to understand how it works.
